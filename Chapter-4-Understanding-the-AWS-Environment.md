# Chapter 4: Understanding the AWS Environment

## AWS Regions
- https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/

- When you request an **instance of an AWS service**, the underlying hardware of that instance will be carved out of a server running in **one — and only one — AWS Region**.
- Dividing resources among regions lets you do the following:
  - Locate your infrastructure geographically closer to your users to allow access with the lowest possible latency
  - Locate your infrastructure within national borders to meet regulatory compliance with legal and banking rules
  - Isolate groups of resources from each other and from larger networks to allow the greatest possible security
